# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts medical insurance charges based on customer attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children using Machine Learning.

The objective of this project is to perform data analysis and build a regression model to estimate insurance costs accurately.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Dataset Features
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Children
- Smoker
- Region
- Charges (Target Variable)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Encoding Categorical Variables
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training using Linear Regression
6. Model Evaluation

## Model
- Linear Regression

## Model Performance
- R² Score (Test Data): 0.745
- The model explains approximately 74.5% of the variance in medical insurance charges.
